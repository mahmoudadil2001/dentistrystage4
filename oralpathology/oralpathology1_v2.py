            "It requires general anesthesia"
        ],
        "answer": "B",
        "explanation": "Cautery chars tissues, making microscopic interpretation difficult."

            "A gingival erythema resolving with brushing"
        ],
        "answer": "A",
        "explanation": "Persistent white/red lesions (>2 weeks) may indicate dysplasia or malignancy and require biopsy."
