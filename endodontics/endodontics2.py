    {
        "question": "What is the most common cause of Acute Apical Abscess?",
        "options": ["Trauma", "Invasion of bacteria from necrotic pulp tissue", "Periodontal disease", "Chemical irritation"],
        "answer": "Invasion of bacteria from necrotic pulp tissue",
        "explanation": "Acute apical abscess occurs due to bacterial invasion from necrotic pulp tissue, leading to localized inflammation and pus formation. Trauma, periodontal disease, or chemical irritation may contribute but are not the primary cause."
    },
    {
        "question": "Which condition is also known as 'Phoenix abscess'?",
        "options": ["Acute apical abscess", "Chronic apical abscess", "Acute exacerbation of asymptomatic apical periodontitis", "Condensing osteitis"],
        "answer": "Acute exacerbation of asymptomatic apical periodontitis",
        "explanation": "A 'Phoenix abscess' refers to a sudden flare-up of an existing asymptomatic apical periodontitis, causing acute symptoms. It appears to 'rise from the ashes' of a previously silent infection."
    },
    {
        "question": "What radiographic feature is characteristic of condensing osteitis?",
        "options": ["Radiolucent area", "Concentric radioopaque area", "Widened PDL space", "Pulp stones"],
        "answer": "Concentric radioopaque area",
        "explanation": "Condensing osteitis appears as a localized, sclerotic (radiopaque) bone response around the apex of a tooth, typically due to low-grade chronic inflammation."
    },
    {
        "question": "Which of the following is NOT a symptom of symptomatic apical periodontitis?",
        "options": ["Tooth tender on percussion", "Dull, throbbing pain", "Spontaneous pain relief", "Pain on mastication"],
        "answer": "Spontaneous pain relief",
        "explanation": "Symptomatic apical periodontitis causes lingering pain, tenderness to percussion, and discomfort on biting. Spontaneous pain relief is more typical of reversible pulpitis."

    },
    {
        "question": "Which condition features a draining sinus tract?",
        "options": ["Acute apical abscess", "Chronic apical abscess", "Condensing osteitis", "Reversible pulpitis"],
        "answer": "Chronic apical abscess",

    },
    {
        "question": "What is the average length of a maxillary first molar?",

        "options": ["Maxillary central incisor", "Maxillary lateral incisor", "Mandibular canine", "Maxillary first premolar"],
        "answer": "Maxillary lateral incisor",
        "explanation": "Maxillary lateral incisors often have a disto-palatal curvature at the apex, complicating instrumentation."

    {
        "question": "What is the shape of the access opening for maxillary first molars?",
        "options": ["Oval", "Triangular", "Rectangular", "Circular"],
        "answer": "Triangular",
        "explanation": "The access cavity for maxillary first molars is triangular, accommodating the MB, DB, and palatal canals."
